## Face recognition with Retinaface and Arcface using c++ TensorRT
- Run Retinaface to detect faces with Deepstream
- Cropped faces by Deepstream will be sent to TensorRT c++ backend for face recognition using ArcFace
- Refer to `deepstream` folder and `tensorrt` folder to build those apps

## Convert model
- [Retinaface](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/master/retinaface)
- [ArcFace](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/master/arcface)
- [Retiface + ArcFace](https://github.com/nghiapq77/face-recognition-cpp-tensorrt/tree/master/conversion)


## Todo
- UI
- Clean code
